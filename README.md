Abstract
--------

Sometimes the things we care about in astronomy are very, very faint.
What happens if members of a certain population are so faint that not
a single example can be observed in any reasonably obtainable data
set?  Can we still say something about the properties of that
population?  Of course!  Here we demonstrate that, using ersatz
exoplanet radial velocity data.
